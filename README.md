# Divergent thermal challenges elicit convergent stress signatures in aposymbiotic <i>Astrangia poculata</i>

Here, we leverage the temperate stony coral, Astrangia poculata, which naturally exhibits a facultative
symbiosis with Symbiodiniaceae, to explicitly examine how thermal challenges influence coral hosts in isolation
from their symbionts. Aposymbiotic A. poculata were collected from Woods Hole, MA, the northern range
limit for this species. Corals were thermally challenged in two independent common garden experiments (Heat
challenge: 31C, 10 days; Cold challenge: 6C, 16 days) to determine the effects of divergent thermal stressors.
Behavioural responses to food stimuli were monitored throughout the thermal challenges and genome-wide
gene expression profiling (TagSeq) was used to characterize molecular underpinnings of the coralâ€™s response
to stress in its aposymbiotic state.

Transcriptome files are organized separately from both heat, and cold experiments. All analyses in R can be found in the file Astrangia_HotCold.pdf along with annotations.
